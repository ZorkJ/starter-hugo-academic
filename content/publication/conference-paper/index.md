abstract: We show that change in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust premium is the single
  most significant predictor of Bitcoin daily return. This sentiment measure is
  similar to the closed-end fund discount measure as in Baker and Wurgler
  (2006), but more likely to reflect the excess demand from traditional
  investors than from blockchain specialists. Although there is a substantial
  variation in Bitcoin price quotes worldwide, this Grayscale premium and
  discount predict Bitcoin daily return for the most liquid Bitcoin exchanges.
  Using K-means clustering and LDA analysis, we find that this predictability is
  especially significant when there is a large variation in bullish and bearish
  market sentiment, innovation regarding CBDC, regulations on crypto exchanges,
  but not when there is innovation regarding blockchain technology or bitcoin
  mining. A simple long and short strategy based on this signal generates a
  daily alpha of 40 bps. These findings suggest that Bitcoin prices react with a
  delay to the information contained in the sentiment of traditional investors
  and investors who are constrained from directly holding Bitcoin.
